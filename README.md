# Mesh Editor

Hammer is not going anywhere (yet) but we want to open the door to creating geometry directly in the scene.
This repo is for mappers that want to try this out early on before we start integrating parts of it into the engine.
This is not intended to be used for your games, yet.

## Features

- Half edge structure, triangulate polygons
- Select faces, extrude, inset, detach, delete
- Select edges, extrude open edges
- Select vertices
- Create block primitives, box, plane, stairs, etc
- Apply materials to faces, adjust uvs
- Move, rotate and scale selection

- ## Usage

- Download repo
- Add as a project in s&box
- Open scene
- Use mesh tools to create geometry
